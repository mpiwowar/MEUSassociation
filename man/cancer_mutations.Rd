\description{
The \code{cancer_mutations} is a matrix (contingency table) representing 
different gene mutations in different cancer types.
}
\details{
Sample dataset was taken from (Kandoth et al., (2013) Mutational
landscape and significance across 12 major cancer types. Nature, 502,
333â€“339.) and consist of information related to mutated genes (with
point mutations and small insertions/deletions) from 3281 tumours across 12
tumour types, groupedd into 11 categories.
Rows correspond to different tumore types and columns to different genes.
